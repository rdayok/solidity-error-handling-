# ErrorHandling

This is a solidity program showing the syntax of error handling.

## Description

Here, I have a smart contract "ErrorHandling" with properties balance, total withdrawn and three functions. The three functions shows
how error handling is done in solidity. The first function is the "addBalance" which shows the basic syntax of the require method for 
handling error. This method takes in two aruguments - the condition and the error message. The second function is the "withdraw",
which shows how the revert method for error handling. And lastly is the "checkTotalWithdrawn". This function shows how the assert method of error handling is done.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g.,ErrorHandling.sol). Copy the code in the file "ErrorHandling.sol" found in the contracts directory into your newly created file "ErrorHandling.sol" on Remix IDE

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.25" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile ErrorHandling.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ErrorHandling" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint or the burn function. Click on the "ErrorHandling" contract in the left-hand sidebar below.
